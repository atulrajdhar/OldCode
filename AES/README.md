AES
===
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specific encryption for electronic data established by the U.S. in 2001.

Since then, it has been adopted by the U.S. government and is used worldwide.

The algorithm described by the AES is a symmetric-key algorithm, which means the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting.

This particular implementation of the AES is targetted for 128-bit encryption and decryption, but it can support other key sizes as well.

It is meant to illsutrate the fundamental steps in the algorithm: key expansion, rounds, sub bytes, shift rows, mix columns, and round key adding.
