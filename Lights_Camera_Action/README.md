Lights Camera Action
====================

Here's 18 Java files related to cameras, light sources, players, game lobbies, shapes, threads, and more.

Although these files won't conglomerate together and play nicely (since you'll be missing many files), this should certainly give some ideas on how you can go about implementing some of these classes.

A full list of included files: 

```
Camera, Cube, Cylinder, DirectionalLightSource, Face, FourPlayerBoard3D, Game, GamePiece, GamePiece3D, LightSource, Lobby, Material, Mesh, Message, MessageChannel, Player, PositionalLightSource, and SpotLightSource.
```
