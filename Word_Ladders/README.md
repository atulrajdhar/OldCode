Word Ladders
=============
Word Ladders. A word ladder begins with two words, and to solve it, you must find a chain of words to link the two. The catch? The two adjacent words must only differ by one letter.

This is a solver for it (albeit not the best algorithm to do it). I will also upload a C-based implementation at a later point.

Sample output: stone, atone, alone, clone, clons, coons, conns, cones, coney, money
