SMTP Automation
================
Hopefully nobody has to use this crap ever.  But you know, maybe it'll be helpful.

Basically this .bat file will try to winscp some crap and then it'll run the vbs to send you an e-mail and whether or not the process succeeded or not.  Pretty shweet.

Also - FYI: if you want to hook this up w/ Gmail, you need to add a port of 465 and enable SSL.
