Polynomial GCD
==============
The Polynomial Greatest Common Divisor of two polynomials is a polynomial of the highest possible degree which evenly divides each of the original two polynomials.

This particular program takes two longs as arguments, converts them into polynomials, and finds the polynomial GCD between them.

As an example, we can see the following with input <5> <10>

>>> Initializing program with arguments <5> <10>

>>> <5> translates to (x^2 + 1)

>>> <10> translates to (x^3 + x^1)

>>> The GCD is x^2 + 1
